# abap_tools
The __ABAP Tools Repository__ is a collection of Useful, Practical and Time Saving ABAP Methods that you can integrated directly in your code.

As an ABAP Developer coming from the web development world and using languages like PHP, Java, Javascript and Python, sometimes I'm surprised to see how little code reuse is actlually implemented in Custom-Code solutions. I'm also sometimes suprised that some common functionalities of other languages in terms of unit conversions, text manipulation, formatting etc are not readly availabe in the standard ABAP repositories.

One explanation for the lack of reuse is the age of most of the code, sometimes thousands of lines long, with lots of duplication in the logic. This presents a huge challenge to anyone maintaining the code, either in terms of complexity or time (a.k.a budget), or both. Other explanation would be would be the difficulty in finding the required functionalities in a timely manner.

While we cannot help you with the first challenge, at least we can try to help you with the second. :)


# Use in Test and Production environments

Note: While we do our best efforts to test the code extensively before publishing it, it is your responsability as a developer to re-test it and check the suitability of the proposed solution before using it in your own code. As an Open-Source Project we cannot take any responsability for any use of this code whatsoever, or give you any guarantee of suitability in any way.

But, if you find any errors or inconsistencies, please contribute back and alert us as soon as possible. Our goal is to publish correct and reliable functionalities, so we would be very thankful for your contribution.

To ensure stability and safety, Security related topics and Bug-Fixing will be done ASAP in the current released version. Minor functionalities will be included in the next Minor (Beta) Version (v.01.XX). Interface changes as well as Major changes will be only included in the next Major (Alpha) Version (v.0X).

# About

I am a proud member of the ABAP community since 2014, working in many development projects along the years using Functional writing with ABAP-OO as my language of choice as much as it is possible to me. I do believe that the ABAP (formerly known as NetWaver) Platform is an amazing working tool.
