Practical time saving ABAP Methods to be use directly in your code

As an ABAP Developer coming from the web development world and using languages like PHP, Java, Javascript and Python, sometimes I'm surprised to see how little code reuse is actlually implemented in Custom-Code solutions.

One explanation is the age of most of the code, sometimes thousands of lines long, with lots of duplication in the code. This is presents a challenge to anyone maintaining the code. Other would be would be the difficulty in finding the required functionality in a timely manner.

While we cannt hel you with the first challenge, at least we can try to help you with the second. :)


# Use in Test and Production environments

Note: While we do our best efforts to test the code extensively before publishing it, it is your responsability as a developer to re-test it and check the suitability of the proposed solution before using it in your own code. 
As an Open-Source Project we cannot take responsability for any use of this code whatsoever, or give you any guarantee of suitability.

# About

I am a proud member of the ABAP community since 2014, working in many development projects along the years using Functional writing with ABAP-OO as my language of choice as much as it is possible to me. I do believe that the ABAP (formerly known as NetWaver) Platform is an amazing working tool.
